[x] first kernel operation
    [x] multiple kernel lengths
    [x] not-fixed/learnable
[x] second kernel operation
    [x] spatial
[ ] optionally first spatial step
    [x] implement
[x] dense
    [x] append input to output
    [x] append input to after spatial layer
    [x] append input to each step
[x] redo first kernel step with option of fixed kernels
[x] add option of bias in temporal layer
[ ] allow for more bias terms than kernels; this should increase number of kernels
[ ] locate TS data, ideally ecg
